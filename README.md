# Welcome to Dancing LED Lights by Parallel Port, C++

 # ðŸ“Œ This is my university project, 2008/11/11.
 I made an LED panel with 200 LEDs similar following:
 
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
        
        
 Unfortunately, I don't remember part of the codes, but I remember that I made dancing between a keyboard, an LED panel, and Seven segments.

 I controlled through a printer parallel port with 8-pin data.

 This project belongs to the System programming course at my university.

 I hope useful.
